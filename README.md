# Analog-Clock

The Analog Clock: Each group must build an analog clock that tells the time (creativity is a must). The clock can be built from anything (cardboard, laser cut pieces, 3D printed, etc.) however, you must use at least one servo.

## Design

### Mechanical Design

Our CAD design is three “Barrels” one for hours, one for minutes and another for seconds.

We also had to design parts to holds the servo in the middle of the barrel with screwable clips.
